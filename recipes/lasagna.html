    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made by layering flat, wide pasta sheets
      with rich fillings. Traditionally, it includes a meat sauce made from
      ground beef or pork cooked with tomatoes, onions, garlic, and herbs.
      Between the layers, you’ll often find creamy ricotta cheese or a smooth
      béchamel sauce, along with generous amounts of melted mozzarella and
      grated Parmesan.
    </p>
    <p>
      The assembled dish is baked until the top is golden and bubbling, creating
      a hearty, comforting meal. There are many variations, including vegetarian
      options with ingredients like spinach or mushrooms, and modern takes that
      cater to vegan or gluten-free diets.
