    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      A boiled egg is an egg cooked inside its shell using heat from boiling
      water. Depending on how long itâ€™s cooked, the texture can range from a
      soft, slightly runny yolk with a tender white to a fully set yolk with a
      firm, dense white. The shell remains intact during cooking, and when
      peeled away, it reveals a smooth, pale egg white encasing the rich yellow
      yolk. The flavor is mild and comforting, often enjoyed on its own or as
      part of a larger dish.

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place eggs in a medium pot and cover with cold water by 1 inch. Bring to
        a rolling boil, then cover the pot and turn off the heat. Let the eggs
        cook, covered, for 9 to 12 minutes, depending on your desired done-ness.
      </li>

      <li>
        Transfer the eggs to a bowl of ice water and chill for 14 minutes. This
        makes the eggs easier to peel. Peel and enjoy!
